Aquadopp and RBR Data processing 

Processing of the WireWalker data using the upcast data:

- Read ctd data (Ruskin). Define upcasts grid aquadopp and ctd data on
the same vertical-time space

- processing of the aquadopp data - from beam velocity to geographical
velocities (North-South-Up)

It is very important to check out the path to the data since it also change with the experiment. 
This "meta-data" aspect of the processing is defined in process_navo.m.
